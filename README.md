# Thief Sling 3D

**Thief Sling 3D** is an action-packed 3D runner mobile game built with Unity. This game was developed during the **Mindstorm Labs Summer Program Rookie Game Jam**, where participants were challenged to create a game using one of three mechanics: Sling Mechanics, Draw Mechanics, or Choice Mechanics. Our team chose Sling Mechanics, crafting an engaging experience where players must skillfully navigate through obstacles and leap towards victory.
